OBJECTS:

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
In real life, a car is an object.
A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop.
All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
The syntax of creating object directly is given below:


Example :
This code assigns a simple value (Benz) to a variable named car:
let car = "Benz";
BUT :
This code assigns many values (Benz, GLS, white) to a variable named car:
const car = {type:"Benz", model:"GLS", color:"white"};[SM1]


 NOTE :

The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
To declare objects with the const keyword is useful.. A shelf with several items in it

In the following sample code, the values are both arrays and objects:

const object2 = {
users: ["Alex", "James", "Mohammed"],
professions: {
alex: "software engineer",
james: "lawyer",
mohammed: "technical writer"
}
};
console.log(object2.users); //['Alex', 'James', 'Mohammed']
console.log(object2.professions); //{alex: 'software engineer', james: 'lawyer', mohammed: 'technical writer'}


Accessing Javascript objects:
The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:
objectName.property
or
objectName[“property”]
Accessing ‘fname’ from example 1 using dot operator,

Accessing ‘name’ form example 2 using [],
