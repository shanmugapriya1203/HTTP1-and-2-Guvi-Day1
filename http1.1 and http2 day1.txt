What is the HTTP/2 Protocol
* HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications.
*  
* More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send    information.
* 
* There have been four HTTP iterations since its introduction in 1991.


HTTP Versions :

* The first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
o This version is still in use on the web
* HTTP/1 was known to have poor response time. With websites becoming more resource-intensive, the protocol was losing its efficiency

Why we switch on HTTP/2:


* HTTP/2 was released in 2015 as a major revision to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. It was derived from the SPDY protocol as a way to improve the online experience by speeding up page loads and reducing round-trip time (RTT), especially on resource-heavy web pages

o HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate

o In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 

* One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process. HTTP/2, based on SPDY protocol, was developed to address the inherent     limitations of  HTTP/1.1 and further progress the Internet.    


          


High Level difference between HTTP1 and HTTp2:

* HTTP2 is binary, instead of textual 
* HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
* HTTP2 can, therefore, use one connection for parallelism
* HTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead

IT’S A VERY REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE OF WHAT MODERN WEBSITE LOOKS LIKE TODAY

My conclusions are therefore:
1.   HTTP/2 is faster in terms of performance and site loading time than HTTP1.x.
2. HTTP/2 allows clients to make multiple requests over one TCP connection while HTTP/1.1 allows only one request (even with request pipelining).
3.   In short, HTTP/2 helps to boost network performance (reduced total number of TCP connections, faster RTT, less resource consumptions) while still supporting all core features of HTTP/1.1
